# SuMo Demo

Demo repository for SuMo

## Smart Contract

CampusCoin (`CC`) is an ERC20-compatible token used within a university ecosystem. It allows:

- The **admin** to manage token related operations, the registration of students and service providers.
- The **university** to collect service fees.
- **Students** to pay Service Providers in CC tokens.
- **Service providers** to receive payments in CC tokens.

## Project Structure
This project follows a standard HardHat layout with additional integration for SuMo.

## Prerequisites
Before interacting with this project, ensure you have the following installed:

* Node.js
* npm (comes with Node.js)

Then, install the project dependencies with `npm install`.


## Commands Cheatsheet

### HardHat (Testing Framework)
HardHat is used to compile, test, and interact with the smart contract.

* Compilng the Smart Contract: `npx hardhat compile`
* Running the tests on the Smart Contract: `npx hardhat test`

### SuMo
SuMo is used to assess the effectiveness of your tests by introducing controlled mutations in your smart contract code.
* Generating the mutants: `npx sumo lookup`
* Running the tests on all mutants: `npx sumo test`
* Running the tests on a specific mutant: `npx sumo test <mutantID>`
